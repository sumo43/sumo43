# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm interested in AI, with a focus on inference and post-training of language models, vision-language models and generative diffusion models. Follow me on [Twitter @sumo43_](https://twitter.com/sumo43_) for updates on whatever i may be working on.

## ðŸ”­ Projects

### [loopVLM](https://github.com/sumo43/loopvlm)
- **Demo:** [Object Detection Demo on X](https://x.com/sumo43_/status/1791589684121903555)  
- **Description:**  
  A fast paligemma inference engine running on the RTX 4090. I built an object detection demo using the siglip-224px model that runs in real time at 20fps.

### [RobotArena](https://x.com/skunkworks_ai/status/1825960894209425619)
- **Description:**  
  RobotArena is an ELO-based ðŸ¤– Robot-Action Model benchmark that lets you test models directly in your browser. This project is a collaboration with SkunkworksAI, allowing users to explore and evaluate robot-action models in a browser.

## ðŸ’¼ Work Experience

### **Brium AI**
**Role:** LLM Inference Engineer  
**Overview:**  
At Brium AI, I worked on accelerating inference for large language models across diverse GPU architectures. My role focused on optimizing the inference stackâ€”from runtime systems to compilersâ€”for long-context LLM applications. This work led to significant improvements in throughput and latency, particularly on AMDâ€™s MI210 and MI300 GPUs.

### **RunPod**
**Role:** ML Engineer  
**Overview:**  
At RunPod, I built an in-house inference engine that supports low-latency workloads with speculative decoding. I also collaborated closely with customers to deploy AI models effectively on the RunPod stack.
